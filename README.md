> ## **_Movie Reviews:_**

_Ricky Roldan:_ I love this movie, very interesting and i Like all the Characters. ❤💕

_Rotten Tomatoes:_ "Black Panther elevates superhero cinema to thrilling new heights while telling one of the MCU’s most absorbing stories -- and introducing some of its most fully realized characters." 👍

_Roger Ebert:_ "Black Panther transcends the superhero genre to emerge as an epic of operatic proportions. The numerous battle sequences float on the surface of a deep ocean of character development and attention to details both grandiose and minute2." 🤞

_Empire:_ "Black Panther is a giddily enjoyable, convention-bucking 134-minute epic that somehow manages to simultaneously be a comic-book blockbuster, a pulsating espionage thriller and an Afro-futurist family saga." ✔

_NME:_ "Black Panther is the first major superhero movie with a predominantly black cast. It’s not just good. It’s the best Marvel movie yet." 🙌
